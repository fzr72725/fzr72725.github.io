# Project-Mash
A Simple Front End Page for storing some of my mash works. Can't use Soundcloud because I have not figured out the license crap yet. This site should not be discovered by the mass (so against my attention whore nature, lol)

- Adding More Functionalities and Features at some point, no promise
- Making more mashes, promise
