# Naked Word: Nationalities of World Language
## Part Six: How to Improve the Classification Accuracy between JPN and KOR?

1. Why do this?
Although the final overall classification accuracy is 81%, which is pretty good considering that I have 9 classes to classify, it is observed that regardless what feature and model I apply, Japanese learner English writings and Korean learner English writings are always likely to be misclassified as each other. Therefore, I believe that it would be fun and meaningful to explore classification just between these two classes, see if I can figure out a way to increase the accuracy.
