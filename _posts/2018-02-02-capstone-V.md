# Naked Word: Nationalities of World Language
## Part Five: What Feature Works Better for Which Class(es)?

Although I have chosen the best feature and model for my text classifier based on the overall classification accuracy score, it is observed that when using different features, a classifier's accuracy score on identifying a specific class varies. Therefore, I believe that it is worth the time to take a closer look at all features I have explored for my project and analyze the effect they each has on identifying certain native language class(es).

1. List of Features to Investigate:
`unique_lemma`
`avg_stc_length`
`DT_max_dp_cnts_std`
`DT_ROOT_idx_mean`
`DT_pos_join`
`DT_insent_arch_ngram`

These are clearly not the entire collection of generated features of my corpus. But I think just by exploring some of them, it will be enough to illustrate certain feature's classification power on certain class(es).

2. Result and Analysis
