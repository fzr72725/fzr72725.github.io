<h2>A Start</h2>
<p>
With a strong conviction for continuous learning, I love writing about things I just learned.
It is a great way to validate how well I grasp the knowledge. Moreover, I believe that by sharing what I learned with others, the audience and I will inspire each other. Therefore, I decided to start this site to put all my learning notes at one single source for mine and others' reference.
